# Malware Image Classification using Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning model that can classify images of benign and malicious software. The model is trained on grayscale images of size 128x128.

> The attached code can convert binary to image and image back to binary

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of two classes:
- Benign software
- Malicious software

The images were preprocessed to grayscale and resized to 128x128 pixels.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- torch
- numpy
- matplotlib
- PIL

## Simple Process

## Model Performance
The trained deep learning model achieved high accuracy in classifying benign and malicious software, with a loss of `0.0039` and an accuracy of `0.9996` on the training set, and a validation loss of `0.0246` and a validation accuracy of `0.9926`.

## Conclusion
The deep learning model was able to achieve a high accuracy in classifying benign and malicious software. The model can be further improved by using a larger dataset and training for more epochs.
